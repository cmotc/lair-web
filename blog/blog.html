<h2>I should just draw a picture</h2>

<h4>by:idk</h4>

<h3>Mon Feb 20 11:28:01 EST 2017</h3>

<p>I'm terrible at writing about this. It's actually simple. The idea is to pretty
much create a scriptable way to give mobs about the same amount of information
as a player, a memory that prioritizes survivable behavior and de-emphasizes,
duplication, and the ability to make decisions by examining their environment
and making decisions based on scripts. The idea is to teach AI's to play the
game like a player. So here's the picture.</p>

<pre><code>    [1] (Launch Game: Read in and check parameters, configuration files)
       \
        \
         [2] (Generate Map: Loop over every cell in the map and decide what
            \ kind of cell it is. This part of the picture TBC)
             \
              [4] (Mobs Think, Player Sees: In the moment just before player
             /   \  takes a turn, mobs poll the environment and plan a move)
            /     \
        [4b]_______[4a] (Player Takes Turn: The player takes a turn right
       (Mobs Do: The   \ before the mobs.)
     plan from step 4)  \
                         [5] (Exit: if the player decides to.)
</code></pre>

<h2>Integrated Web-Site Building</h2>

<h4>by:idk</h4>

<h3>Mon Feb 20 11:19:29 EST 2017</h3>

<p>As I work on this documentation, I'm getting really good at re-building all the
packages, repositories, installers, and web-sites automatically. That's pretty
cool. Still need to get things crystallized though.</p>

<h2>AI Controls Mostly Enabled, Mostly undocumented!</h2>

<h4>by:idk</h4>

<h3>Mon Feb 20 10:44:58 EST 2017</h3>

<p>Well I've got the system for moving information from the native part of the
engine to the scriptable part of the engine which lets me take information from
the running game and make decisions about what to do with it from the scripted
part of the engine, which is the model for the AI. On a per-mob basis, the
native part of the game tests a region surrounding the mob for collisions. This
is the mob's line-of-sight, metaphorically speaking. Everything that is in that
region is placed in a lua table and made accessible to a function. This function
by default is "default()" but it can also look for a function defined at map
generation time. The return value of this function is a move that the mob is
allowed to make. As usual, I'm mostly, but not entirely, keeping up at writing
documentation for how to actually use it.</p>

<h2>Nervously Enabling AI Controls</h2>

<h4>by:idk</h4>

<h3>Sat Jan 28 16:17:15 EST 2017</h3>

<p>Well it's about time I actually start getting used to this development blog.
Today I'm going to get the beginnings of the Mobile Non-Player Entities going,
and by that I mean I'm going to make their behavior scriptable. I'm trying to
plan the whole thing very carefully, because LAIR is supposed to be a minimal
resource organizer that outputs a game. Ideally, I'd like to register as few
functions with Lua as possible and limit the amount of information available to
any given Mob. For now, I'm just going to make them all run into the nearest
northward wall, though. Once that's done, I'm going to make a new screencap to
put on the homepage.</p>

<h4>Remaining Features to Implement:</h4>

<ul>
<li>AI Scripts(in progress)</li>
<li>Network(Will be using Tox for networking, no servers, also because Tox is
cool.)</li>
<li>Game Balance, Cheating Definition/Prevention(basically, when you join
someone else's server, that server makes a copy of you, then it kills your
clone as slowly as possible. This process makes it possible to deduce all the
stats without relying on the player to report them accurately. Getting to know
new players, Sun-Tzu Style. Then all new players are required to meet within
a standard deviation(or something like this, so to speak) of the Player
Generation Script used by the player running the Server.)</li>
<li>Player Generation(Basically, a player supplies parameters to a script which
tells the map what kind of character they want to play. This lets you create
characters on a per-scenario basis, or players can use their own player
generation scripts.)</li>
<li>GUI Launcher(A GUI should be created which should be allowed to select the
same parameters as the CLI Parameters in an appealing, self-explanatory way.</li>
</ul>
