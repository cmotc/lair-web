<h1>LAIR! Development Blog</h1>

<h2>Nervously Enabling AI Controls</h2>

<h4>by:idk</h4>

<h3>Sat Jan 28 16:17:15 EST 2017</h3>

<p>Well it's about time I actually start getting used to this development blog.
Today I'm going to get the beginnings of the Mobile Non-Player Entities going,
and by that I mean I'm going to make their behavior scriptable. I'm trying to
plan the whole thing very carefully, because LAIR is supposed to be a minimal
resource organizer that outputs a game. Ideally, I'd like to register as few
functions with Lua as possible and limit the amount of information available to
any given Mob. For now, I'm just going to make them all run into the nearest
northward wall, though. Once that's done, I'm going to make a new screencap to
put on the homepage.</p>

<h4>Remaining Features to Implement:</h4>

<ul>
<li>AI Scripts(in progress)</li>
<li>Network(Will be using Tox for networking, no servers, also because Tox is
cool.)</li>
<li>Game Balance, Cheating Definition/Prevention(basically, when you join
someone else's server, that server makes a copy of you, then it kills your
clone as slowly as possible. This process makes it possible to deduce all the
stats without relying on the player to report them accurately. Getting to know
new players, Sun-Tzu Style. Then all new players are required to meet within
a standard deviation(or something like this, so to speak) of the Player
Generation Script used by the player running the Server.)</li>
<li>Player Generation(Basically, a player supplies parameters to a script which
tells the map what kind of character they want to play. This lets you create
characters on a per-scenario basis, or players can use their own player
generation scripts.)</li>
<li>GUI Launcher(A GUI should be created which should be allowed to select the
same parameters as the CLI Parameters in an appealing, self-explanatory way.</li>
</ul>
