Description: A tool for setting up and hosting an apt repository using arbitrary
 http/s hosts to make files accessible with extra features for git-enabled
 hosting sites.
 .
 This tool, currently called apt-now but soon to be changed to repo-now, is
 essentially a static site generator geared toward generating and formatting a
 specific type of content in a specific type of way, the content being GNU/Linux
 or Android/Linux binary packages, and the format being a signed repository
 accessible from the web or something like  it  (It can also, for instance, be
 used to statically host software  repositories over i2p with no substantial
 modification.) It does this by taking  advantage of the structural regularity
 of these types of resources and  constructs the whole site on the client side,
 transmitting content to the  server only after a valid repository has been
 built. This means that the server  doesn't have to run any code at all to
 present the site to the end-user taking advantage of the resource over the web,
 doesn't need to support ssh or remote desktop, and doesn't even technically
 need to support ftp or git, as long as a way of transferring the repository to
 the remote storage service can be included in the program.

Description: Generates a Markdown-formatted description of a software package
 and a corresponding html page. For use with my repo generator, apt-git so that
 it can generate package description pages automatically and make the
 repositories easier to browse. It's a very, very basic little script. I don't
 intend to expand it or make it smarter, instead I'm going to use it by
 redirecting it's output and processing that. It uses dpkg --info to read the
 contents of your debian package, grep and sed, and doesn't need bash, so it
 should run fine on any Debian-based system.
