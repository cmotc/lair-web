LAIR Artistic Assets Repository
- -------------------------------

Repository for the artistic assets of my video game. They're sort of paper-doll
style sprites, in that they are designed to be stacked one atop the other until
they form a complete picture. And they could be much more complex if I had that
kind of time, so I'm sort of going for a Teleglitch:DME artistic style in the
end. The website here is just to get a handle on the resources.

Installation
============

Debian/Ubuntu:

To build a debian package without installing it, run:

        make deb-pkg

or, to install it, run

        sudo make deb-pkg

On other Linux/Unixes, to rebuild the indexes run

        make

and to install the packaged files run

        sudo make install

Inventory
=========

For now, a pretty minimal amout of art is available. Basic characters, enough
wall and floor detail to test map generation.
