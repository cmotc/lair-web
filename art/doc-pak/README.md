# LAIRArt
Repository for the artistic assets of my video game. They're sort of paper-doll
style sprites, in that they are designed to be stacked one atop the other until
they form a complete picture. And they could be much more complex if I had that
kind of time, so I'm sort of going for a Teleglitch:DME artistic style in the
end. The website here is just to get a handle on the resources.
