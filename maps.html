<h1>LAIR's Lua-Based Configuration for Level Generation</h1>

<p>LAIR is scriptable in several ways in order to facilitate it's ability to do
Procedural Content Generation.</p>

<h2>Terminology:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Floor: Floor is a synonym for Map as Map is used in this document. In the
Vala code, a Map is always referred to as a Floor, and a stack of Maps is
always referred to as a Tower. Each is basically a layer of syntactic sugar
for manipulating the smaller data structure.</p></li>
<li><p>Room: Rooms are organized units of Particles and Mobiles. Each room has
retrievable properties and has</p></li>
<li><p>Entity: Entity is an organized unit of data(it's a type) that corresponds to
the minimum interactable unit of content. A single floor tile is a single
Entity, as is a single wall, as is a single monster and the player itself. All
the direct interaction in the game is done strictly on an entity->entity
basis.</p></li>
<li><p>Particle: A particle is an entity which never has any effect on another
entity UNLESS that effect is to trigger a non-damaging collision. In essence,
an otherwise benign wall is always a particle. It's still the same kind of
entity, but since these types of entities will be A) Commonplace, and
B) Guaranteed to never do <em>most</em> of the things other entities will sometimes
do, it makes sense to skip alot of steps when they take their turns.</p></li>
<li><p>Mobile: A mobile is an entity which is interactive in some way or another.
It might be damaging to the player if it is touched, it might be possible to
add to your player's inventory, it might be able to converse eventually.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Map Configuration:</h2>

<h3>The Map Generation Loop</h3>

<p>LAIR's maps are made of "Rooms" and "Particles." Rooms have fixed dimensions,
for instance, 480 pixels by 480 pixels(which is wequivalent to 15 tiles in-game)
but they don't necessarily have walls or any other features at all until they
are filled with particles. Particles are a list of "Entities" which correspond
to features of the environment like walls and surfaces, whereas Mobiles are
entities that do more interesting things(Technically this is an arbitrary
distinction, but there are alot of things walls and surfaces will never do that
other entities will so it makes sense to skip some checks on Particles). The
list of particles is generated at the start of the game by looping over all the
possible particle positions and making a decision about what to put there by
calling functions contained in Lua scripts. In order to generate a dungeon,
a dungeon generation script must contain the following 8 functions.</p>

<h4>User-Defined Lua Functions Selecting Particle Entities</h4>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>map_cares_insert:()</strong>  [ <em>Returns: bool</em> ] This determines whether the
map is going to bother to insert a Particle in this square whatsoever. If the
value is false, then none of the other selection functions will be run for
that Particle.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>map_image_decide:()</strong>  [ <em>Returns: Array of Strings</em> ] This determines
whatattributes the image selected for the new particle should have. It returns
an array of strings which corresponds to a set of tags. The tags will be
checked against the game resources and a random image with all the tags will
be retrieved.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>map_sound_decide:()</strong>  [ <em>Returns: Array of Strings</em> ] This determines
what attributes the sound selected for the new particle should have. It
returns an array of strings which corresponds to a set of tags. The tags will
be checked against the game resources and a random sound with all the tags
will be retrieved.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>map_fonts_decide:()</strong>  [ <em>Returns: Array of Strings</em> ] This determines
what attributes the font selected for the new particle should have. It returns
an array of strings which corresponds to a set of tags. The tags will be
checked against the game resources and a random font with all the tags will be
retrieved.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>User-Defined Lua Functions Selecting Mobile Entities</h4>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>mob_cares_insert:()</strong>  [ <em>Returns: bool</em> ] This determines whether the
map is going to bother to insert a Mobile in this square whatsoever. If the
value is false, then none of the other selection functions will be run for
that Mobile.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>mob_image_decide:()</strong>  [ <em>Returns: Array of Strings</em> ] This determines
what   attributes the image selected for the new mobile should have. It
returns an array of strings which corresponds to a set of tags. The tags will
be checked against the game resources and a random image with all the tags
will be
retrieved.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>mob_sound_decide:()</strong>  [ <em>Returns: Array of Strings</em> ] This determines
what attributes the image selected for the new mobile should have. It returns
an array of strings which corresponds to a set of tags. The tags will be
checked against the game resources and a random image with all the tags will
be retrieved.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>mob_fonts_decide:()</strong>  [ <em>Returns: Array of Strings</em> ] This determines
what attributes the image selected for the new mobile should have. It returns
an array of strings which corresponds to a set of tags. The tags will be
checkedagainst the game resources and a random image with all the tags will be
retrieved.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>mob_ai_decide:()</strong>  [ <em>Returns: String</em> ] This determines the function
that will be run during the game for the generated mob's AI Input Loop. This
determine's the mob's runtime behavior. The string it returns should
correspond to the identifier of a function in ai.lua(Or the specified Mob ai
file.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These functions must be defined in your dungeon generate script in order for it
to work. If not, a common one will be used which I haven't written yet, but
it'll shoot for the bare minimum.</p>

<h3>Making Decisions about Particle Placement by Querying Information about the Map</h3>

<p>Obviously you need to have some information about the map to be able to "decide"
what tiles to place where. To accomplish this, every time the loop runs LAIR
informs the Lua VM of the maps characteristics. The map generation scripts can
then query this information to decide whether they want to place a new Particle
or Mobile in a given place.</p>

    end
</code></pre>

<h4>Dynamic Variables Exported to Global Scope in Lua From Vala During Map Generation</h4>

<p>During map generation, Vala also keeps a running list of the tags associated
with the entities in all the rooms on a per-room basis. This list is then
exported along with the numeric prevalence of the tag. This allows you to
retrieve stats about what the room contains from Lua in greater detail and grow
a more balanced dungeon. These are all created as Table entries with a default
field "<em>c</em>" containing a running count of the tag's prevalence.</p>

<p>Retrieving these values safely without stopping the Lua interpreter requires
first checking if they are <em>nil</em>. An invalid script will result in an empty or
malfunctioning dungeon. To help keep this from happening, I recommend using
the accessor functions</p>

<p><strong>get_tag_count():</strong> checks for the existence of a table and if it exists,
returns it, otherwise, returns entry "<em>c</em>," for count.</p>

<pre><code>    function get_tag_count(variable)
            if type(variable) == "table" then
                    return variable.c
            else
                    return 0
            end
    end
</code></pre>

<p><strong>get_tag_table():</strong> checks for the existence of a table and if it exists,
returns it, otherwise, returns zero.</p>

<pre><code>    function get_tag_table(variable)
            if type(variable) == "table" then
                    return variable
            else
                    return 0
            end
    end
</code></pre>

<h4>Tile-Specific Data Retrieval Functions</h4>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>particle_index_byxy(x, y):</strong> Returns the tags of the particle who's
corner is at fine x, y as a long, space-delimited string.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>particle_coarse_index_byxy(x, y):</strong> Returns the tags of the particle
who's corner is at coarse x, y as a long, space-delimited string.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>is_blocked_particle_here()</strong> Detects if there is or is not a particle
at the current location of the map generation cursor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>mobile_index_byxy(x, y):</strong> Returns the tags of the mobile who's corner
is at fine x, y as a long, space-delimited string.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>mobile_coarse_index_byxy(x, y):</strong> Returns the tags of the mobile who's
corner is at coarse x, y as a long, space-delimited string.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>is_blocked_mobile_here()</strong> Detects if there is or is not a particle
at the current location of the map generation cursor.</p></li>
</ul>

<h5>*Why Tables?</h5>

<p>I'd like to say I planned this or even that I think it's inherently the best
way, but neither of those things are true. I think it's an acceptable way, and
that it might be useful to add things on to the tables for each variable while
the dungeon is being generated.</p>

<h2>Building Upon the Basic Functions Effectively</h2>

<p>In order to create re-usable code chunks which can help produce better maps
faster, some basic patterns should be followed. It is possible to write your
own functions, in your own external files, to influence the output of the
dungeon generator scripts in any complex way you want as long as it's possible
to accomplish with Lua.</p>

<h3>Example Function: Build a Thick Wall around the Outside of the Floor</h3>

<p>First thing to notice is that the functions usually take an optional argument.
This optional argument is the running result of the parent decision function.
If the argument isn't provided, have the result default to "false."</p>

<pre><code>    function thinwall_cares_insert(vari)
            if type(vari) == "string" then
                    decided_to = vari
            else
                    decided_to = "false"
            end
</code></pre>

<p>Because the coordinates of the tiles start at 0 and not 1, when the cursor is
at less than 1 we draw a wall.</p>

<pre><code>            if where_in_floor_get_x() &lt; 1 then
                    decided_to="true"
            end
            if where_in_floor_get_y() &lt; 1 then
                    decided_to="true"
            end
</code></pre>

<p>And again, because we count from zero, to get a wall of thickness 1 on the far
side we test if we are greater than farcorner - 2.</p>

<pre><code>            if where_in_floor_get_x() &gt; where_is_floor_farcorner_x() - 2 then
                    decided_to="true"
            end
            if where_in_floor_get_y() &gt; where_is_floor_farcorner_y() - 2 then
                    decided_to="true"
            end
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, return the result.</p>

<pre><code>            return decided_to
    end
</code></pre>

<p>By doing this, you can declare a single variable in your map_cares_insert
function and transform it by repeatedly feeding it to functions like this.</p>

<pre><code>    function map_cares_insert()
            result = thickwall_cares_insert()
            result = cut_hallways(result)
            result = thinwall_cares_insert(result)
            return result
    end
</code></pre>

<p>This map_cares_insert function in the share/lair/demo/dungeon.lua file creates
a thick border, then textures it, then seals the walls with a thin border, while
leaving a vast empty space between. Minimal demo map achieved.</p>

<h1>LAIR's Lua-Based Configuration for Programmable Mob Behavior</h1>

<p>While the basics of the Map Generator are provided and now basically expect few
changes to the underlying functions, there are going to be alot of features of
the AI that will probably rapidly change. This is because we have to do one or
more of three things right now to make the AI work. We either have to</p>

<ol>
<li>Make the AI generator select basic behavior based on the tags that the map
generation loop used to generate the mob's appearance. That's fucking racist.</li>
<li>Make the Map generator specify random default behavior based one one more
function it would need to support. I don't want to get back into the map
generator yet, but it's still imperfect and this feature will probably be
added shortly as it's the most appealing way to specify default behavior for
the mobs. {While writing this, I chose this solution. Here to record the fact}</li>
<li>Make it possible to modify the default AI behavior while the game is
running. Basically make it possible for an entity to export "tags" of it's
current behavioral state to influence the outcome of it's behavioral function.</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, it might be of note that self-modifying code is indeed possible by putting
the code in a separate file and having lua do_file that code within a function.
This is not yet recommended, but it's being seriously considered.</p>

<p>So without further ado, LAIR AI functions.</p>

<h2>What are AI functions</h2>

<p>Unlike Map functions, AI functions are not pre-defined. The dungeon designer
defines AI functions of his own in the ai.lua(or other lua file as directed) on
his or her own and decides the function that each Mobile will use at the</p>

<h2>How AI Functions are decided per-Mobile</h2>

<p>They are set at runtime, during the Mob Placement phase of Map Generation, by
the mob_ai_decide() function.</p>

<h2>AI Function Helpers: Environment Information Gathering</h2>

<p>TBD.</p>

<h2>AI Function Hooks: Making Mobs take Actions</h2>

<p>Will correspond to the move functions for players, mostly.</p>

<h2>AI Examples</h2>

<p>TBD.</p>

<h2>LAIR AI Library</h2>

<p>TBD.</p>

<h2>Current Limitations</h2>

<p>Because the map generator currently works from left to right, then from top to
bottom, and because by definition all the information that the map can recieve
has to come from entities that the map has already initialized, there is bias
inherent in how the maps are generated. This issue will be solved shortly by
having 2 Map Generation loops for structural elements. This will make it easier
to create things like hidden treasures and decorated walls and allow reductive
map generation, which will aid in generating Mazes.</p>

<p>I still haven't done the Lua configuration for AI controlled entities. That's
changing slowly, it's not something I want to do too fast.</p>

<p>Some of the tables are counter-intuitively or unclearly named. I'll get to it
about the time I get to converting the Vala to standard formatting. The
functions are the preferred way to access the variables. I think they're pretty
much consistent now so that's OK at least.</p>
